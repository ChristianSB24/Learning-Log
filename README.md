# Learning Log
I completed this project from scratch with a Django backend and React frontend. The web application features create, read, update, and delete functionality in addition to authorization and authentication that are powered by the Django Rest Framework. React Hooks was utilized to manage state in the application and the Bootstrap framework was used to style the user interface.
